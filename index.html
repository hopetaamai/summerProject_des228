                <h2> My name is Hope Ta'amai</h2>
                <p> Hope is a Senior Visual Communications major at San Francisco State University. 
                    She initially began her academic journey at Sonoma State University, pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s in Biochemistry, but pivoted during the 2020 global pandemic. 
                    While preparing to transfer, she earned a certificate in Visual Media Design Foundations at City College of San Francisco before transferring to SFSU in 2024.
                </p>
                <p>A 25-year-old artist from the Bay Area, Hope is a first-generation college student. 
                    As the daughter of immigrants who made great sacrifices to provide her with better opportunities, her family's experiences have deeply influenced the way she navigates life. 
                    From a young age, Hope has always expressed herself through art. As a self-taught artist, she has evolved from drawing on school desks to developing a distinct visual voice. 
                    Her work is deeply inspired by her Samoan heritage, incorporating cultural motifs, patterns, and personal experiences. 
                    Upon graduation, Hope aspires to build a career in Art or Creative Direction, collaborating with like-minded creatives to bring innovative ideas to life.
                </p>
                <p>In her free time, Hope enjoys drawing on her iPad, spending time with her sisters, and listening to music. 
                    With a Taurus Sun, Capricorn Moon, and Scorpio Rising, Hope approaches her personal and professional life with determination, creativity, and passion.</p>
