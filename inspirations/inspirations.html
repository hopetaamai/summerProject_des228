        <h3> Lucid Luca </h3>
        <p> "Luca Tu’avao Walton is a Tongan-Kiwi artist from the “Polynesian capital of the world,” Tāmaki Makaurau. 
             His work is a “reflection of his heritage, cross-cultural identity, and memories of his childhood surrounding the vibrant Kingdom of Tonga.” 
             He draws inspiration from his upbringing in the lagoon side of the hamlet of Matika, Tongatapu, and the strength and character of the Pasifika women who’ve played an important role in his life. 
             What inspires me the most about his artwork is the way he paints these beautiful portraits of Pasifika women, as well as the intricate details of cultural symbolism, patterns, and myths.
             It almost feels like an Oceanian fantasy.

            <h3> Parris Goebel </h3>
            <p> Parris Gobel is a trailblazing dancer, choreographer, and Polynesian pioneer from New Zealand. 
                Fierce and incredibly talented, Parris has made a significant impact in a space where Polynesian representation is often limited. 
                She inspires me to passionately pursue my love for art and shows me that there is a place for Polynesian women like myself. 
                As both a woman and an artist, Parris’s journey motivates me to continue striving for greatness in my own creative path.

                    She holds a BFA from Elam, an MA in Art History, and apprenticed with Su’a Sulu’ape Alaiva’a Petelo. 
                    Specializing in the malu, her work symbolizes protection, identity, and lineage.
